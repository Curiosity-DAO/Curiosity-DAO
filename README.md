# Curiosity DAO

All of the code needed for the Curiosity DAO Governance Token and website.
It's far from being ready, but I'm constantly working on updating and adding things.

For the website code, check out the `website` folder.<br>
For the token smart contracts, check out the `token_contracts` folder.

## `./webstie`
## Curiosity DAO Website/Airdrop Interface

For CC readers/community members, they'll need an interface to claim their token airdrops.
I'm going to build a website (preferably with help from better web devs) to do this.

### Note

I don't actually have any idea of what I'm going to do yet, but I'll be working on it!

## `./token_contracts`
## Curiosity DAO Token (CC)

This is the set of contracts needed for the deployment of the CC governance token for the Curiosity DAO.
The contracts in `setup.sol` all come from [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/tree/master/contracts).

Links to specific contracts:

- [Context](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/Context.sol)
- [Ownable](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/access/Ownable.sol)
- [IERC20](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol)
- [IERC20Metadata](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/IERC20Metadata.sol)
- [ERC20](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol)
- [ERC20Capped](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20Capped.sol)

### Note

Curiosity isn't finished yet. At the moment, I plan to release everything 1st January 2022, but that can change anytime.
I'm a single developer who is also working to publish a newsletter every week and trying to build a community around it.
