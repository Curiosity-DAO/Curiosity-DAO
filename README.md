# Curiosity DAO Token (CC)

This is the set of contracts needed for the deployment of the CC governance token for the Curiosity DAO.
All contracts except 'Curiosity' itself come from https://www.github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/tree/master/contracts.

ERC20Capped can be found at https://www.github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20Capped.sol and
Ownable can be found at https://www.github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/access/Ownable.sol.

All other contracts used are imported into those two.

# Note

Curiosity isn't finished yet. At the moment, I plan to release everything 1st January 2022, but that can change anytime.
I'm a single developer who is also working to publish a newsletter every week and trying to build a community around it.

My DM's are always open :)
