# Curiosity DAO

All of the code needed for the Curiosity DAO Governance Token and website.
It's far from being ready, but I'm constantly working on updating and adding things.

For the website code, check out the `website` folder.<br>
For the token smart contracts, check out the `token_contracts` folder.

### Security

The airdrop is insecure again; that was done on purpose.
An airdrop can be claimed by anyone, but it won't be left like that for long.
The contract will be fixed before the official launch.

## `webstie`
## Curiosity DAO Website/Airdrop Interface

For CC readers/community members, they'll need an interface to claim their token airdrops.
The website is in the process of being built, but is far from done.

You can look at Issue #1 on the [Curiosity-DAO page](https://github.com/Curiosity-DAO/Curiosity-DAO/issues/1) for more info.

## `token_contracts`
## Curiosity DAO Token (CC)

This is the set of contracts needed for the deployment of the CC governance token for the Curiosity DAO.
The contracts in `setup.sol` all come from [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/tree/master/contracts).

Links to specific contracts:

- [Context](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/Context.sol)
- [Ownable](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/access/Ownable.sol)
- [IERC20](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol)
- [IERC20Metadata](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/IERC20Metadata.sol)

### Note

Curiosity isn't finished yet. At the moment, I plan to release everything 1st January 2022, but that can change anytime.
There are a total of 3 developers working on this repository at the moment, but we could always use more.
If you would like to help out with anything (please do), please reach out to me on Twitter [@theLucasWalters](https://twitter.com/theLucasWalters) or in our Discord server ([here](https://discord.gg/Xs293sZAkW/)).

If you contribute to the code in a meaningful way before the token airdrop, you'll be included on the whitelist.
You can also subscribe to the CryptoCurious newsletter on [Substack](https://lucaswalters.substack.com/) to claim an airdrop without doing any work if you so choose.
